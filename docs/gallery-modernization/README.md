# Gallery Modernization Plan

## Overview
Complete modernization plan for Storegården 7 gallery system, replacing react-image-gallery with a custom lightweight solution and implementing advanced loading strategies.

## Documentation Structure

This plan is broken down into focused parts for easy implementation:

### 📋 [Part 1: Current State Analysis](./part-1-current-state.md)
- Existing implementation analysis
- Performance bottlenecks
- Feature inventory
- Bundle size impact

### 🎯 [Part 2: Phase 2 - Custom Lightbox Plan](./part-2-custom-lightbox.md)
- Architecture design
- Component structure
- Feature mapping from react-image-gallery
- Implementation strategy

### 🔍 [Part 3: Phase 3 - Intersection Observer Plan](./part-3-intersection-observer.md)
- Smart loading strategies
- Performance optimizations
- Lazy loading implementation
- Category-based preloading

### 📅 [Part 4: Implementation Timeline & Execution](./part-4-timeline-execution.md)
- Day-by-day breakdown
- Dependencies and risks
- Migration strategy
- Success metrics

### 🛠️ [Part 5: Technical Specifications & Code Examples](./part-5-technical-specs.md)
- Complete code examples
- API designs
- Testing strategies
- Browser compatibility

## Quick Start
1. Read Part 1 to understand current state
2. Review Part 2 & 3 for technical approach
3. Follow Part 4 for step-by-step execution
4. Reference Part 5 during implementation

## Expected Outcomes
- **74% smaller bundle** (57KB → 15KB)
- **Faster loading** with intersection observer
- **Better UX** with custom controls
- **Complete control** over gallery behavior
